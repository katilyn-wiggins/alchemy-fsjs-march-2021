# HTTP Static File Server

Create a node server that serves files from a public directory.

If a user hits your server at `http://localhost:7890/index.html`
your server should go into the `public` directory and find an
`index.html` file, read it, and send the contents as a response.
If no file is found respond with a Not Found message.
