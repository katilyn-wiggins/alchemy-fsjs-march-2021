# DVD Rental Aggregations

[Get Started Here](https://classroom.github.com/a/7JBVBTe_)

Using the [DVD Rental Data](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/)
provided by the [PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) you are going
to preform a series of aggregations.

You only need to edit the `exercise-*.sql` files **NOT** the tests.
